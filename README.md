Building Zeckendorf's Telescope to Peek into the digits of Pi

Shrinivas Ramanujan (1887-1920) developed the first accelerated converging series of Pi. This series has been optimized through different algorithms, such as the Chudnovsky algorithm and the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula. We combine the two fundamentals concepts of integration theory and number theory to derive and accelerate a method to compute the nth digit of Pi accurately. By using Zeckendorf's theorem (every positive integer can be represented uniquely as the sum of one or more distinct Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include two consecutive Fibonacci numbers), we are able to develop a novel lookup method. By tabulating the nth Fibonacci number and its associated series correction, we are able to show the viability of accelerating the computation of the nth digit Pi by using the BBP formula. A secondary objective is to show that there exist Lucas numbers (a generalized Fibonacci sequence) that avoid certain hexadecimal digit, which could shed light on the normalcy of Pi. Our experiments to date show that there exists Lucas numbers, which avoid the digit ‘D’ (decimal 13) up to the 45th term (which is already close to the 3 trillionth digit of Pi).
